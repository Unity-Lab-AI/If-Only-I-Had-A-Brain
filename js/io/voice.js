  // order: 1. _speakPiper 2. _speakVox 3. browser SpeechSynthesis" — and closed
  // with "Throwing keeps that same fall-through path intact", describing a
  // fall-through path that no longer exists.
  //
  // ⭐ A COMMENT THAT CONTRADICTS A RULING IS HOW THE RULING GETS QUIETLY
  // REVERSED BY THE NEXT READER. There is ONE lane now, `_speakPiper`, and if
  // it cannot run she is silent with the reason named. See `speak()`.
  //
  // What it used to do, kept as one line of history rather than a page: it
  // POSTed her text to an outside chat model with an instruction to repeat it
  // verbatim and played back the returned audio — an outside model producing
  // her voice. The rule: no third-party text-to-speech — her voice comes from
  // the project's own equations.
  //
  // ⚠ `_pollTtsDead` went with it. It was READ at two sites and ASSIGNED at
  // none: the 401 handler that used to set it left with the lane, so both
  // cooldown guards had been permanently unreachable.

  // ⚠ ORPHANED 2026-09-01 — `_playWithAudioContext` and `_playWithAudioElement`
  // below both have ZERO callers. They decoded a compressed `arrayBuffer` (an
  // mp3/opus response body), which only the deleted external-TTS lane ever
  // produced; her own lanes carry raw Float32 PCM and play through `_playPcm`.
  // ⛔ DELETED 2026-09-02 (on an instruction to gut the old text-to-speech path
  // that is no longer needed). Keeping a dead lane so a warning has somewhere to
  // live is how the warning outlives the reason for it. The note stays, the
  // code goes. `_currentAudioElement` went too — it was set ONLY by
  // `_playWithAudioElement`, so the branch in `stopSpeaking` that checked it
  // was already unreachable.
  // The three deleted here were `_playWithAudioContext`,
  // `_playWithAudioElement` and `_speakBrowser`.
  //
  // The first two decoded a compressed `arrayBuffer` — an mp3/opus RESPONSE
  // BODY, which only the external TTS ever produced. Her own lanes carry raw
  // Float32 PCM through `_playPcm`, so neither could fire again.
  //
  // ⭐ `_speakBrowser` was tier 3 of the removed chain: the BROWSER'S OWN
  // generic speech synthesis, hunting for a "Samantha" or a "Microsoft Zira"
  // to stand in for her. **It was the worst part of that chain** — a listener
  // could not tell which tier produced a sentence, so "Unity spoke" meant
  // three different things and the page never said which. **A stock robot
  // voice presented as her voice is the audio equivalent of a canned answer.**
