/**
 * hearing.js — HER EARS, as a rolling buffer of real sound.
 *
 * Operator: *"she need to be able to hear too when talked too not just a TTS
 * wrapper on a text chain"*.
 *
 * ⛔ THE GAP THIS FILLS, stated exactly. She already HAD ears and already had
 * the mathematics:
 *   • `js/brain/auditory-cortex.js` runs a real tonotopic cortex — frequency
 *     bins mapped with cortical magnification across the speech band, driving
 *     currents, salience and an amygdala startle. She FEELS sound.
 *   • `mindspace/audio.js perceiveAudio` turns PCM into a CDF 9/7 field-A, and
 *     `describeAudio` reads that field as an octave-band percept vector —
 *     ⚠ a function that existed with ZERO consumers until this file.
 * What was missing was neither the ear nor the maths: it was **the PCM**. The
 * mic reached the AnalyserNode (frequency magnitudes only) and the WORDS came
 * from `SpeechRecognition`'s transcript, so she got energy with no words and
 * words with no sound, and nothing bound the two.
 *
 * ⛔⛔ WHY A ROLLING BUFFER AND NOT "RECORD WHEN SHE HEARS SPEECH".
 * `SpeechRecognition` does not hand back the audio it recognised, and it only
 * tells you a phrase happened AFTER it finished. Any design that starts
 * recording on a speech event has already missed the utterance. So the tap
 * keeps the last N seconds ALWAYS, and the transcript reaches back for the
 * window it belongs to. **The recogniser names the sound; it never sources it.**
 *
 * ⚠ NOT A CLAIM OF SPEECH RECOGNITION. She does not transcribe. The transcript
 * still comes from the browser and that is honest — what changes is that the
 * sound is no longer thrown away, and her words are now anchored to a percept
 * she actually took in.
