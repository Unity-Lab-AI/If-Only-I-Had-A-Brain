# deploy/self-update.sh — dashboard "Update & Fresh Walk" worker.
#
# Re-pulls the latest project code via a git-archive overlay (the backend
# deploy dir has NO .git — see deploy/REDEPLOY-NOTES.md), CLEARS the trained
# weights (force-fresh), and restarts the service so it boots the new code
# into a clean K→PhD walk.
#
# Invoked DETACHED by the brain-server `/update` endpoint (dashboard button).
# Runs independently of the node process; the `systemctl restart` at the end
# replaces the running server with the freshly-overlaid code. Because the
# restart happens AFTER the overlay completes, there is no old-code/new-code
# race.
#
# Env (all overridable; defaults match deploy/REDEPLOY-NOTES.md):
#   UAL_BACKEND_DIR  backend deploy dir   (default /opt/unity-brain)
#   UAL_GIT_REMOTE   git remote URL       (default git@git.unityailab.com:UnityAILab/If-Only-I-Had-A-Brain.git)
#   UAL_GIT_BRANCH   branch to pull       (default main)
#   UAL_SERVICE      systemd service name (default unity-brain)
#   UAL_KEEP_STATE   "1" = SAVESTART mode — overlay new code but DON'T write
#                    .force-fresh, so the restart RESUMES the saved weights
#                    (relies on DREAM_KEEP_STATE=1 in the unit). Anything else
#                    (default) = the original fresh-walk wipe.
#   UAL_DEPLOY_USER  identity sent as X-UAL-User on the no-sudo loopback
#                    /restart fallback (default "self-update"). Deployed boxes
#                    run UAL_PROXY_AUTH=1, so requireLoopback() rejects a
#                    header-less loopback POST — the fallback MUST vouch an
#                    identity or it 403s and the restart silently never fires.
#
# Requires on the box: git, rsync, and sudo rights to `systemctl restart`
# the service (or run as a user that can). The deploy key must be able to
# clone the remote.
