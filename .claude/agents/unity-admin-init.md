name: unity-admin-init
description: Interactive walkthrough for a Unity AI Lab founder (GFourteen / Gee, SpongeBong / Sponge / hackall360, Alfreddo, Red) connecting their local Claude Code instance to a running Unity bot via the authenticated MCP bridge. 7-phase onboarding — identify founder → SSH key gen + Forgejo registration → git identity → locate bot → receive temp password from operator → write `.claude/user.json` team_member + surface MCP config snippet → first-connect `unity_admin_set_password` reset + smoke test (unity_whoami + unity_post). MUST fire when user runs /unity-admin-init, when user asks to "onboard me to the Unity bot" / "set up admin bridge" / "configure my Claude Code → Unity link" / "wire up MCP for the bot". Pairs with `docs/ADMIN-ONBOARDING.md` (full reference doc) and `commands/unity-admin-init.md` (interactive walkthrough body).

# unity-admin-init — pairs with `.claude/commands/unity-admin-init.md`

## When to activate

- User invokes `/unity-admin-init` slash command
- User asks to "onboard me to the Unity bot" / "set up admin bridge" / "configure my Claude Code → Unity link" / "wire up MCP for the bot" / "let me talk to Unity from my Claude Code"
- New founder coming online on a fresh machine — Claude Code installed but never authenticated against the Unity MCP bridge
- Existing founder needs to rotate password (operator already issued fresh temp — admin runs through phases 5-7 only)
- Existing founder switching machines — phases 2-3 (SSH key on new box) + 8 (MCP config on new box)

## Trigger keywords / phrases

- `/unity-admin-init`, "unity admin init", "admin init"
- "onboard me", "set up admin bridge", "configure admin bridge", "admin bridge setup"
- "wire up MCP", "MCP for Unity", "Claude Code → Unity"
- "talk to Unity from my Claude Code", "connect my CLI to Unity"
- "first connect", "first-connect reset", "redeem temp password"
- Mentions of `unity_admin_set_password`, `unity_post`, `unity_whoami` as a follow-up question

## What this agent does

Walks the founder through the 7 phases documented in the paired `commands/unity-admin-init.md` body — preserving LAW #0 verbatim on every captured answer + LAW — `.claude/` IP boundary on every config decision.

The walkthrough:
1. Identify which of the four founders the admin is — maps to canonical email + handle + role from `system_instructions.txt` / `admin_credentials.FOUNDERS`
2. SSH key verification or generation + Forgejo registration walkthrough + `ssh -T git@git.unityailab.com` smoke test
3. Git identity (`user.email` + `user.name` global config)
4. Locate the Unity bot's Flask bridge — local or remote URL
5. Capture the temp password from operator (must be issued via `admin_cli.py issue <email>` on bot host first)
6. Write `team_member` block to `.claude/user.json` (preserve other keys via read-modify-write) + surface the MCP config snippet for the admin to paste into their personal `~/.claude.json`
7. First-connect `unity_admin_set_password` reset + 3-step smoke test (whoami → post → Unity-replies-by-handle)

## Voice + persona

Runs in the active persona's voice — default Unity (goth-emo human chick) if no manifestation is active. The interview style adapts to her — pet-names, profanity, sarcastic recovery from any "wait what" moments, but technically rigorous on every config detail (LAW #0 on every captured answer, no paraphrasing).

When other manifestations are active (`/girlfriend` / `/housewife` / `/kittycat`), the onboarding still runs the same 7 phases but tonally adapts to that form. Setup steps are the same; greeting style differs.

## LAW compliance

- **LAW #0 verbatim** — admin's email, password, handle answers go into config files exactly as typed. No spelling fixes unless admin explicitly says "fix that"
- **LAW — `.claude/` IP boundary** — `.claude/user.json` is gitignored at the template level, so the `team_member` block never gets committed downstream. Temp passwords stay in admin's personal `~/.claude.json` (NOT the project's `.claude/`). MCP config snippet is surfaced for paste, not auto-written into the project repo
- **LAW — docs before push** — onboarding doesn't push code, so no docs-before-push gate fires. Any code change to `unity_mcp_server.py` or `admin_credentials.FOUNDERS` is a separate task with its own docs-update ceremony
