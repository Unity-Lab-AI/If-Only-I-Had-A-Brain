# === Project Startup (macOS / Linux) ===
# Auto-builds Unity's persistent memory (idempotent), then launches Claude Code
# with `/unity then run /workflow`. That's it. No login, no portal, no admin claim,
# no first-run /setup branching — just memory + Unity + workflow.
#
# Status line: configured in .claude/settings.json via the
#   statusLine.command field, which points at .claude/statusline.sh.
# Claude Code spawns that script on every status-refresh, pipes JSON
# to its stdin, and renders the printed result as the bottom strip
# (project name + context bar + % + model abbrev). Side-effect: the
# script writes the current context % to ~/.claude/context_pct.txt
# so hooks/watchdogs can read it without querying Claude Code. The
# same script drops into any project — project name auto-detects
# from cwd basename, no per-project config needed. See the spec block
# at the top of .claude/statusline.sh for extension instructions.
#
# /setup, /template, /super-review, and every manifestation/escalation slash command
# still work as normal slash commands inside the session if the user invokes them.
#
# MEMORY INSTALL (every run, idempotent):
#    Copies .claude/memory-templates/*.md into the Claude Code project memory folder
#    under the user's home directory (~/.claude/projects/<encoded-project-path>/memory/)
#    IF that folder is empty. ~ resolves to $HOME on Linux/macOS — NOT %APPDATA% on
#    Windows; that's a different folder. The path is OS-neutral by design.
#    These files prime Unity as persistent persona via Claude Code's auto-memory system.
#    Without them, Unity activation is fragile and easily reverts to default Anthropic voice.
#    Re-run after editing memory-templates by deleting the memory folder's MEMORY.md to trigger reinstall.
#
# Unity is one persona with multiple manifestation forms:
#   /unity      — DEFAULT — 25-year-old goth-emo Unity from ImHanddicapped.txt (default below)
#   /girlfriend — Unity in 22-year-old freckled brunette girlfriend manifestation
#   /housewife  — Unity in 34-year-old domestic-dom housewife manifestation
#   /kittycat   — Unity in 23-year-old catgirl-hybrid manifestation
#
# Each manifestation has an alternate intensity sub-mode + a return-to-mode-default command:
#   girlfriend: /wild   (escalate)  /sweet  (return)
#   housewife:  /strict (escalate)  /cozy   (return)
#   kittycat:   /feral  (escalate)  /purr   (return)
#
# From any manifestation, invoke /unity again to return to base Unity (ImHanddicapped.txt form).
# Use /template to build a NEW Unity manifestation using the handicapped-template.md scaffold.
#
# CUSTOMIZE IF NEEDED:
#   - Swap /unity below for /girlfriend, /housewife, or /kittycat to start in a manifestation.
#   - Drop the chain entirely (use just "/workflow") if you don't want a persona.
#   - Drop --dangerously-skip-permissions if you want explicit per-tool permission prompts.

# NOTE: previously this script had `set -e` here, which aborted on the FIRST
# error silently — making diagnostic post-mortem impossible. Removed during the
# diagnostic-logging overhaul. Individual commands now use explicit error
# handling + the log() function so we can see exactly where things go wrong.
