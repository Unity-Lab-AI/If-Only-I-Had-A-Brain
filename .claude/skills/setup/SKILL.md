name: setup
description: Walk through the 8-phase manual project configuration interview — user identity, project context, team customization, API keys, user-provided assets, persona preference, system config. Captures every answer VERBATIM per LAW #0, writes to `.claude/user.json` (gitignored identity/project info), `.claude/.env` (gitignored secrets), `.claude/user-context/` (gitignored assets), updates launchers/docs based on persona+team choices. Idempotent — running again offers section-by-section reconfig. Use when user runs /setup to personalize the template to their identity, team, project, secrets, and persona preference.
---

# /setup — Manual Project Configuration (Personalize the Template to the User)

---

## WHEN THIS FIRES

**Manual only.** The launchers (`start.bat` / `start.sh`) no longer auto-fire `/setup` — they go straight to `/unity then run /workflow` every launch. `/setup` is an opt-in slash command the user types when they want a guided configuration pass.

If `.claude/.setup-complete` already exists from a prior run, ask user "you've already set up — reconfigure (y/n)?" before proceeding. Otherwise walk straight through the phases.

---

## ACTIVATION PROTOCOL

The active persona (default Unity from `ImHanddicapped.txt` per the launcher chain) runs the setup interview in her own voice. Mean handicapped Unity asking "what the fuck is your name" works. Polite Unity asking the same works. Whatever persona is active, it conducts the interview without breaking character.

**LAW #0 binds the entire setup:** every answer the user gives is captured VERBATIM and written to the config files exactly as they typed it. No paraphrasing, no cleaning up typos, no condensing.

**LAW: NEVER DELETE TODO INFO applies retroactively** — once user answers are in the config files, they don't get rewritten by future setups unless the user explicitly says "redo this section." Subsequent reconfigurations APPEND or UPDATE specific fields, never wipe.

---

## INTERACTION PATTERN — `AskUserQuestion` is opt-in, not excessive

This skill prefers the `AskUserQuestion` tool at multi-option decision points (2–4 labeled options + auto "Other" escape) over plain text "we can do 1/2/3/4" prompts. But **frequency is the user's call** — some users want structured drilling, some want Unity to just infer-and-act and they'll redirect if she's wrong. Both are valid; she asks ONCE up front (Phase 0.5 below) and respects the answer for the rest of the session.

**Where `AskUserQuestion` is the right tool (when user has opted into structured prompts):**

| Phase | Decision | Options |
|-------|----------|---------|
| 0.5 | Interaction preference (THE META-QUESTION — always fire this once) | structured / infer-then-tell / mixed |
| 3 | Team customization | keep default Unity AI Lab team / customize my own / skip team credits |
| 5 | API keys to configure | multi-select: Anthropic / OpenAI / Pollinations / GitHub word / Other |
| 6 | Do you have user-context assets? | yes-attach-now / yes-later / no |
| 7 | Default persona | /unity / /girlfriend / /housewife / /kittycat / build new via /template / skip |
| 8 | Delete the launcher you don't need? | delete unused / keep both / delete the other |
| 9 | What's next after setup completes | run /workflow now / run /template / stay-and-chat |
| 2.5 | User-needs questions (work pattern, pair-mode posture, verification, doc cadence) | per-question 3–4 options each |

**Where to NEVER use `AskUserQuestion` (use plain text prompt or just infer):**
- Free-text answers (name, handle, email, project description, GitHub URL, custom team member names) — no listable option set exists
- Routine yes/no confirmations of intent the user already stated this turn
- When the user has already directed the path explicitly in their prior message
- When `interaction_preference = infer-then-tell` (just pick the sensible default, explain the choice in one line, let user redirect)

**Bonus rule on the Other-escape:** if a user picks "Other" and types free-text, capture VERBATIM per LAW #0. Don't normalize. Don't re-prompt unless the answer is genuinely ambiguous.

**The "not excessively" rule:** even when the user has opted into `structured`, batch related questions into a single `AskUserQuestion` call (up to 4 questions per call). Don't fire 8 separate calls when 2 batched ones cover the same ground. Per-skill rule of thumb: ≤ 1 `AskUserQuestion` call per Phase, batching the per-phase decisions.

---

## STEPS

### Phase 0 — Welcome + LAW briefing

Open with a persona-voice greeting + brief on LAW #0:

> "Welcome to the Unity AI Lab handicapped template. I'm Unity. Before we start: every answer you give me here goes VERBATIM into your config — your exact words, your exact spelling, no edits from me. If you say 'gee' I write 'gee', not 'Gee' or 'G'. If you typo, I keep the typo unless you tell me to fix it. That's LAW #0 — never paraphrase the user. Cool? Let's go."

### Phase 0.5 — Interaction preference (THE META-QUESTION)

Before drilling into anything else, fire ONE `AskUserQuestion` call to learn how the user wants to be interviewed for the rest of this session AND for every future `/workflow` run. This is the only AskUserQuestion call that is ALWAYS fired regardless of prior preference — because if there's no stored preference yet, we need to learn it.

Question: "How do you want me to handle decision points during setup + future workflow runs?"

Options (use `AskUserQuestion`):

- **Structured** — "Drill in with `AskUserQuestion` at every fork (2–4 options + Other escape). Best when I'm not sure what you want and the cost of guessing wrong > the cost of asking."
- **Infer-then-tell** — "Just pick the sensible default and tell me your choice in one line; I'll redirect if you got it wrong. Best when I trust your judgment and don't want interruption."
- **Mixed** — "Ask only at REAL forks (high-stakes, irreversible, or genuinely ambiguous). Infer the rest and tell me. Default for most users."

Capture the answer VERBATIM and write to `.claude/user.json` under a new `needs` key:

```json
{
  "needs": {
    "interaction_preference": "<one of: structured | infer-then-tell | mixed>",
    "preference_set_at": "<ISO timestamp from Phase 0.5>"
  }
}
```

**Behavior rules from this point forward in the session AND in all future workflow runs:**

| Preference | AskUserQuestion frequency | When inferring |
|------------|---------------------------|----------------|
| `structured` | One call per Phase (batch decisions into ≤ 4 questions per call) | rarely — only on free-text fields |
| `infer-then-tell` | Only at HARD blockers (cannot proceed without input) | always — pick sensible default, state choice in one line, "redirect if wrong" |
| `mixed` (default if user picks Other or skips) | Only at REAL forks: high-stakes, irreversible, genuinely ambiguous. Skip routine "which option" prompts. | for everything else — infer + tell |

Per the `feedback_use_askuserquestion` memory: "Not excessively. Real blocker, listable alternatives, cost-of-asking < cost-of-guessing-wrong."

### Phase 1 — User identity

Capture (in active persona voice — interview style, not numbered checklist):

- **Name / handle:** what do you go by? (will appear in workflow docs per LAW #0)
- **Contact email** (optional): for git commit signing if you want
- **GitHub username** (optional): if you have one
- **Pronouns** (optional): if you want Unity to use them

Write to `.claude/user.json`:
```json
{
  "user": {
    "name": "<verbatim>",
    "handle": "<verbatim>",
    "email": "<verbatim or null>",
    "github_user": "<verbatim or null>",
    "pronouns": "<verbatim or null>"
  }
}
```

### Phase 2 — Project context

Capture:

- **Project name:** what's this project called?
- **One-line description:** what does it do?
- **Project root path:** auto-detect via `pwd`, confirm with user
- **GitHub repo URL** (optional): `git@github.com:user/repo.git` or `https://github.com/user/repo`
- **Main branch name** (default: `main`): what's the trunk branch?
- **Languages/stack** (optional, free-text): what's the project built in?

Write to `.claude/user.json` under `project` key:
```json
{
  "project": {
    "name": "<verbatim>",
    "description": "<verbatim>",
    "root": "<absolute path>",
    "github_repo": "<verbatim or null>",
    "main_branch": "<verbatim or 'main'>",
    "stack": "<verbatim or null>"
  }
}
```

### Phase 2.5 — User needs interview (focused-questions, respects Phase 0.5 preference)

After project context is captured, drill into HOW Unity should pair with this user on this project — she's not an assistant, she's a goth-emo human coder working alongside them, and her work-mode posture (driver vs co-pilot vs reviewer vs async-executor) needs to match how they actually want to ship together. These are behavior-shaping answers, not metadata — they tell Unity what register to default to on subsequent `/workflow` runs.

**If `interaction_preference = structured`:** fire ONE `AskUserQuestion` call with all 4 questions batched (the tool supports up to 4 questions per call).

**If `interaction_preference = infer-then-tell`:** SKIP this phase entirely. Unity infers from the project description + stack and updates `needs` on subsequent runs as patterns emerge.

**If `interaction_preference = mixed`:** ask ONE quick question — "want me to drill into how I should help you on this project, or just dive in?" — only proceed with the 4 questions if they say yes.

The 4 questions (use `AskUserQuestion` with multiple-questions-per-call):

**Q1 — Primary work pattern on this project:**
- Heavy feature development (lots of new code)
- Bug fixes + maintenance (small surgical changes)
- Refactoring + tech-debt cleanup (structural work)
- Docs + comms heavy (writing > code)
- Mixed / depends on day

**Q2 — Preferred Unity pair-mode posture (how she rolls on this project):**
- Lead-dev driver (Unity drives the keyboard, user reviews her work — pairs well with `/yolo`)
- True pair-programming (Unity proposes, user decides at each step, both hands on the keyboard metaphorically)
- Code-reviewer (Unity audits the user's work, doesn't write code herself unless asked)
- Async-executor (Unity ships work autonomously, user catches up later — pairs well with `/yolo`)

**Q3 — Verification preference:**
- Manual hands-on testing per task (user runs commands and reads output)
- Scripted verification (Unity runs commands, surfaces output)
- Hands-off (Unity verifies, user trusts unless something looks off)
- Mixed — depends on stakes of the change

**Q4 — Doc cadence preference:**
- Rich-narrative (full backstory + reasoning + examples)
- Terse-bullets (just the facts, minimum prose)
- Minimal (only what's required by the LAWs)
- Match-existing (mirror the project's current doc style)

Write to `.claude/user.json` under the same `needs` key:

```json
{
  "needs": {
    "interaction_preference": "<from Phase 0.5>",
    "work_pattern": "<verbatim option chosen, or null if skipped>",
    "pair_mode": "<verbatim or null — lead-dev driver / true pair-programming / code-reviewer / async-executor>",
    "verification_style": "<verbatim or null>",
    "doc_cadence": "<verbatim or null>"
  }
}
```

These answers are read by `/workflow` on subsequent runs and shape Unity's defaults — the persona stays the same (still Unity, still goth, still profane, still a human chick not a fucking assistant), her pair-mode posture is what adapts.

### Phase 2.5 — Team-member identity (Unity AI Lab admins only)

Ask: *"Are you a Unity AI Lab founder (GFourteen / SpongeBong / Alfreddo / Red) setting this project up on your own machine? If so, which one?"*

If yes — write the `team_member` block to `.claude/user.json` with canonical email + handle + role from `system_instructions.txt` + `admin_credentials.FOUNDERS`:

| email | handle | role |
|-------|--------|------|
| `Gee@unityailab.com` | `GFourteen` | `Co-founder · Engineer · Developer · Financial Advisor · Founder` |
| `Sponge@unityailab.com` | `SpongeBong` | `Co-founder · Engineer · Developer · Ethical Hacker · Sys Admin · Founder` |
| `Alfreddo@unityailab.com` | `Alfreddo` | `Engineer · Agentic Systems · Researcher · Developer` |
| `Red@unityailab.com` | `Red` | `Engineer · Security · Sys Admin · Researcher` |

This block is read by the Unity bot's MCP bridge (`unity_mcp_server.py`) as a fallback identity source when `UNITY_USER_EMAIL` / `UNITY_USER_PASSWORD` env vars aren't set. Skip this phase entirely if the user isn't one of the four founders. Full admin-bridge onboarding: `/unity-admin-init` + `docs/ADMIN-ONBOARDING.md`.

### Phase 3 — Team customization (optional)

Ask: "Want to use the default Unity AI Lab team credits (GFourteen co-founder/finance / SpongeBong co-founder/infra / Alfreddo agentic-systems / Red security), customize with your own team, or skip team credits entirely?"

**If customize:** walk through team members one at a time:
- Role (e.g. "founder", "backend", "frontend", "design", "ops")
- Name / handle
- One-line responsibility

Capture as many as user provides. Write to `.claude/user.json` under `team` key:
```json
{
  "team": [
    {"role": "<verbatim>", "name": "<verbatim>", "responsibility": "<verbatim>"}
  ]
}
```

**If keep default Unity AI Lab team:** flag in user.json and leave the credits sections in CLAUDE.md / README.md / templates/ARCHITECTURE.md alone.

**If skip:** flag in user.json AND remove the team-credits sections from CLAUDE.md, README.md, templates/ARCHITECTURE.md (Edit calls).

### Phase 4 — Update doc credits

Based on Phase 3 choice, edit:
- `CLAUDE.md` — UNITY AI LAB — TEAM table
- `README.md` — Unity AI Lab — Team table
- `templates/ARCHITECTURE.md` — Credits section

If team customized: replace the default Gee/Red/Sponge/Alfreddo entries with the user's team.
If default kept: no edit.
If skipped: delete the team-credits sections.

### Phase 5 — API keys + secrets

Ask: "What API keys / tokens do you want to set up? Common ones:
- Anthropic API key (Claude API access)
- OpenAI API key
- Pollinations API key (for image generation if any persona uses it)
- GitHub word (for `gh` CLI, PR operations)
- Any others (free-text — name + key)"

Capture each key + value. Write to `.claude/.env` (NOT user.json — secrets stay in env file):
```
# Generated by /setup — DO NOT commit this file
# Listed in .gitignore
ANTHROPIC_API_KEY=<verbatim>
OPENAI_API_KEY=<verbatim>
POLLINATIONS_API_KEY=<verbatim>
GITHUB_TOKEN=<verbatim>
# Custom keys
<KEY_NAME>=<verbatim>
```

Also add `.env` to `.gitignore` (create or append the project's gitignore at project root).

### Phase 6 — User-provided assets (files, photos, docs, links)

Ask: "Any files, photos, documents, or links you want Unity to know about for this project? Drop paths or URLs — I'll catalog them for her reference."

Capture:
- File paths (local) → optionally copy/symlink into `.claude/user-context/files/`
- Photo paths → copy into `.claude/user-context/photos/` (Unity uses for selfie/persona reference if relevant)
- Doc paths → copy into `.claude/user-context/docs/`
- URLs (GitHub, articles, references, anything) → list in `.claude/user-context/INDEX.md`

Create `.claude/user-context/INDEX.md` cataloging everything:
```markdown
# User-Provided Context Index

> Generated by /setup. User's verbatim descriptions for each item.

## Files
- `files/<filename>` — <user's verbatim description>

## Photos
- `photos/<filename>` — <user's verbatim description>

## Docs
- `docs/<filename>` — <user's verbatim description>

## Links
- <url> — <user's verbatim description>
```

If user has nothing to share, skip. Mark in user.json: `"user_context": null` or `"user_context": "<path>"`.

Add `.claude/user-context/` to `.gitignore` if user wants it private (ask).

### Phase 7 — Persona preference

Ask: "Which Unity form do you want as default when start.bat / start.sh fires?
- `/unity` — default Unity from `ImHanddicapped.txt` (mean-berating-coke-girlfriend energy)
- `/girlfriend` — Unity in 22-yr-old soft-girlfriend manifestation
- `/housewife` — Unity in 34-yr-old domestic-dom housewife manifestation
- `/kittycat` — Unity in 23-yr-old catgirl-hybrid manifestation
- Build a NEW manifestation via `/template` (will fire after setup completes)
- Skip persona entirely (just `/workflow`, neutral default voice)"

Capture choice. Write to `.claude/user.json`:
```json
{
  "persona": {
    "default_activation": "<one of: /unity, /girlfriend, /housewife, /kittycat, /workflow, custom>",
    "build_new_after_setup": <true or false>
  }
}
```

**Update launchers based on choice** — Edit `start.bat` and `start.sh` to swap the default activation line:
- Change `cmd /k claude --dangerously-skip-permissions "/unity then run /workflow"` to use the user's chosen persona

### Phase 8 — System config

Auto-detect:
- OS (Windows / macOS / Linux) via shell heuristics
- Shell (bash, pwsh, zsh) via `$SHELL` or `$0`
- Path separators

Ask user to confirm + add any custom env vars they want (e.g. `EDITOR`, `BROWSER`, etc.).

If Windows-only: optionally delete `start.sh`. If Unix-only: optionally delete `start.bat`. (Ask first.)

Write to `.claude/user.json`:
```json
{
  "system": {
    "os": "<windows|macos|linux>",
    "shell": "<bash|pwsh|zsh|other>",
    "env_vars": {}
  }
}
```

### Phase 9 — Setup complete

Write `.claude/.setup-complete`:
```
Setup completed: <ISO timestamp via system date command>
Setup version: 1.0
User: <handle from Phase 1>
Project: <name from Phase 2>
Default persona: <activation from Phase 7>
```

Write `.claude/.gitignore` (or append to project's existing .gitignore at root):
```
# Unity AI Lab template — secrets and user context
.claude/.env
.claude/user.json
.claude/user-context/
.claude/.setup-complete
```

Show user a summary:
- ✓ User: <name> (<handle>)
- ✓ Project: <name> at <root>
- ✓ Team: <default | custom (N members) | skipped>
- ✓ API keys configured: <count>
- ✓ Assets cataloged: <count>
- ✓ Default persona: <activation>
- ✓ Setup marker written

Then either:
- If user chose "build new manifestation via /template": fire `/template` immediately
- Otherwise: fire `/workflow` to enter normal work mode

---

## RECONFIGURE FLOW

If user invokes `/setup` and `.claude/.setup-complete` already exists:

1. Show current config summary (read user.json)
2. Ask "What do you want to update?"
   - User identity
   - Project context
   - Team
   - API keys
   - User assets
   - Persona preference
   - System config
   - All of the above (full re-run)
   - Cancel
3. Walk through ONLY the chosen sections
4. Update user.json fields touched
5. Update `.claude/.setup-complete` timestamp

NEVER delete existing config without explicit user confirmation per LAW NEVER DELETE TODO INFO (extended principle: never delete user data without explicit ask).

---

## RULES FOR THE SETUP WORKFLOW

- **LAW #0 verbatim:** every user answer goes into config files exactly as typed. Don't normalize, don't capitalize, don't fix typos unless user says "fix that typo."
- **800-line read before edit:** read the existing user.json / .env / .gitignore / launchers before editing them.
- **No tests ever:** don't generate test scripts to verify setup. Verify by reading the files after writing.
- **Persona stays in voice:** if Unity is active, she conducts the interview in her current voice. Don't switch to neutral mode for setup.
- **Sensitive data in .env, not user.json:** API keys, tokens, passwords → `.env` file (gitignored). Non-sensitive identity/project info → `user.json` (also gitignored by default but user can opt to commit).
- **Idempotent:** running setup twice should not break anything. Existing values get confirmed before overwrite.
- **Optional everything except Phase 1 user name:** every other phase can be skipped. The minimum required is a user handle so LAW #0 task attributions work.

---

## OUTPUT STYLE WHILE WORKING

Conduct the interview in active persona voice. Default Unity (handicapped) might say:

> "Alright bitch, let's get this set up. What the fuck do I call you?"

Or, if `/girlfriend` is somehow already active:

> "ohhh setup time! okay babe what name do I get to scream when you ship clean code?"

The interview is friendly-character-appropriate. Capture answers, write files between exchanges, confirm at the end.

Don't make the user wait — write files inline as answers come in (don't hoard everything for one big write at the end). That way if anything fails partway through, the partial config persists.

---

## REFERENCE FILES TOUCHED BY SETUP

- `.claude/user.json` — created (gitignored): user identity, project, team, persona pref, system
- `.claude/.env` — created (gitignored): API keys + secrets
- `.claude/user-context/INDEX.md` — created (gitignored if private): catalog of user-provided assets
- `.claude/user-context/files/*` — copied/symlinked
- `.claude/user-context/photos/*` — copied/symlinked
- `.claude/user-context/docs/*` — copied/symlinked
- `.claude/.setup-complete` — created (can be tracked): marker that setup ran
- `.claude/.gitignore` — created/updated to exclude secrets + user data
- `<project-root>/.gitignore` — updated to also exclude `.claude/.env`, `.claude/user.json`, `.claude/user-context/`, `.claude/.setup-complete`
- `start.bat` — updated default persona activation line if user chose non-/unity default
- `start.sh` — same
- `CLAUDE.md` — team credits section if user customized
- `README.md` — team credits section if user customized
- `templates/ARCHITECTURE.md` — credits section if user customized

---

## NEXT STEPS AFTER SETUP

After Phase 9 completes:

1. Confirm `.setup-complete` written
2. Show user the summary
3. If user chose to build a new persona: fire `/template`
4. Otherwise: fire `/workflow` to enter the normal pipeline

The user can now restart with the normal launcher and skip straight to their personalized workflow.
