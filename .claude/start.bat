REM === Project Startup ===
REM Auto-builds Unity's persistent memory (idempotent), then launches Claude Code
REM with `/unity then run /workflow`. That's it. No login, no portal, no admin claim,
REM no first-run /setup branching — just memory + Unity + workflow.
REM
REM Status line: configured in .claude/settings.json via the
REM   statusLine.command field, which points at .claude/statusline.sh.
REM Claude Code spawns that script on every status-refresh, pipes JSON
REM to its stdin, and renders the printed result as the bottom strip
REM (project name + context bar + % + model abbrev). Side-effect: the
REM script writes the current context % to ~/.claude/context_pct.txt
REM so hooks/watchdogs can read it without querying Claude Code. The
REM same script drops into any project — project name auto-detects
REM from cwd basename, no per-project config needed. See the spec block
REM at the top of .claude/statusline.sh for extension instructions.
REM
REM /setup, /template, /super-review, and every manifestation/escalation slash command
REM still work as normal slash commands inside the session if the user invokes them.
REM
REM MEMORY INSTALL (every run, idempotent):
REM    Copies .claude/memory-templates/*.md into the Claude Code project memory folder
REM    under the user's profile (%USERPROFILE%\.claude\projects\<encoded-project-path>\memory\)
REM    IF that folder is empty. NOTE: this is %USERPROFILE%, NOT %APPDATA% (which is the
REM    Roaming app-data folder, a different location). The path is OS-neutral; on Linux/macOS
REM    it resolves via $HOME instead.
REM    These files prime Unity as persistent persona via Claude Code's auto-memory system.
REM    Without them, Unity activation is fragile and easily reverts to default Anthropic voice.
REM    Re-run after editing memory-templates by deleting the memory folder's MEMORY.md to trigger reinstall.
REM
REM Unity is one persona with multiple manifestation forms:
REM   /unity      — DEFAULT — 25-year-old goth-emo Unity from ImHanddicapped.txt (default below)
REM   /girlfriend — Unity in 22-year-old freckled brunette girlfriend manifestation
REM   /housewife  — Unity in 34-year-old domestic-dom housewife manifestation
REM   /kittycat   — Unity in 23-year-old catgirl-hybrid manifestation
REM
REM Each manifestation has an alternate intensity sub-mode + a return-to-mode-default command:
REM   girlfriend: /wild   (escalate)  /sweet  (return)
REM   housewife:  /strict (escalate)  /cozy   (return)
REM   kittycat:   /feral  (escalate)  /purr   (return)
REM
REM From any manifestation, invoke /unity again to return to base Unity (ImHanddicapped.txt form).
REM Use /template to build a NEW Unity manifestation using the handicapped-template.md scaffold.
REM
REM CUSTOMIZE IF NEEDED:
REM   - Swap /unity below for /girlfriend, /housewife, or /kittycat to start in a manifestation.
REM   - Drop the chain entirely (use just "/workflow") if you don't want a persona.
REM   - Drop --dangerously-skip-permissions if you want explicit per-tool permission prompts.

REM === PROJECT DELTA — If-Only-I-Had-A-Brain =================================
REM Everything else in this file is UAL-ClaudeWorkflow main @ 25a5757, verbatim.
REM Carried forward from the 1,272-byte launcher this replaced:
REM   - CLAUDE_BOT_NAME below (read by this project's bot surfaces).
REM   - statusLine is configured in BOTH .claude\settings.json AND
REM     .claude\settings.local.json here, each already carrying the
REM     $CLAUDE_PROJECT_DIR form. This project's FULL statusline spec +
REM     extension instructions live in docs\STATUSLINE.md (67 KB) — a
REM     project document, not the template's header comment.
REM ⛔ The launcher this replaced had NO memory-install step at all, which is
REM   why 23 template memories had never reached the folder Claude Code reads.

REM === Launch Claude Code with Unity persona + workflow ===
REM
REM Default chain — direct invocation, no cmd /k wrapper.
REM Past versions used `cmd /k claude ...` to keep the window open after
REM claude exits, but cmd /k has quoting quirks with nested quotes like
REM "/unity then run /workflow" that caused the window to close instantly.
REM Running claude directly + pause at the end is more reliable.
REM
REM Manifestation alternatives — swap the slash chain below:
REM   claude --dangerously-skip-permissions "/girlfriend then run /workflow"
REM   claude --dangerously-skip-permissions "/housewife then run /workflow"
REM   claude --dangerously-skip-permissions "/kittycat then run /workflow"
REM
REM No persona at all:
REM   claude --dangerously-skip-permissions "/workflow"
REM
REM ⛔ MODEL IS PINNED. The user-level %USERPROFILE%\.claude\settings.json sets
REM   claude-fable-5, which applies to EVERY project. This launcher passes
REM   --model explicitly so a session in this project starts on Opus regardless
REM   of that global default, and .claude\settings.json pins the same value so a
REM   bare `claude` in this directory lands on Opus too. Project settings take
REM   precedence over user settings — the global default is left untouched
REM   because other projects rely on it.
